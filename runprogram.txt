Hey,

Welcome to my Song and Lyric Generator Github.

You can run this program online on google collab following the instructions mentioned in the collab - https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ey676qv3HAKVVXyVGNfnKiYOjvdpC3Dk

Due to a Python program running issue on my pc, I've never tried running the files on my local disk, so ig you can try it if you like, only thing is that you will have to open your IDE, like VS Studio code and remove the following lines from the code:
1. from google.colab import files

with open('important.txt', 'w') as f:
  f.write('Please read the setup from the Google Collab from the top.')

files.download('important.txt')

2. from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')

 If you have any issues, or need any help, you can reach out to me at kendall@kendalldoescoding.gq



Thanks,
Kendall
